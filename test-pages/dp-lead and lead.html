                                <p class="lead">Stars are the engine of the universe, creating most of the matter we know. In this lesson, we'll explore the incredible story of their origin, starting with a massive cosmic cloud called a nebula and its dramatic collapse due to gravity. You'll discover the star's entire life cycle, from its explosive 'ignition' to its final stage. <br /><br />By the end of this lesson, you&rsquo;ll gain the skills to perform your own astronomical work, using formulas to process and analyze stellar data to calculate a star's brightness, color, and temperature. These skills&mdash;processing large data sets, understanding sensor calibration, and computational analysis&mdash;are directly transferable to careers in industrial control, advanced manufacturing, and technical diagnostics.<br /><br />Get ready to trace the stellar life cycle from nebulae to the brilliant points of light we see tonight!</p>

            <h3>Typography Comparison</h3>
            
            <h4>Regular paragraph text:</h4>
            <p>This is regular paragraph text with standard font size and weight. Notice the difference in visual prominence compared to the lead text above.</p>
            
            <h4>Lead paragraph text:</h4>
            <p class="lead">This is lead paragraph text (.lead class). It's larger and more prominent than regular text, used for introductory content that should stand out.</p>
            
            <h4>dp-lead text:</h4>
            <p class="dp-lead">This is dp-lead text (.dp-lead class). It's even larger and lighter weight, typically used for quotes or special callout text.</p>
